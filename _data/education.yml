    At KJSIEIT, I developed my skills in the field of Electronics and Telecommunications which developed my interest in Computer Vision and Robotics. I was also a member and team leader of the Robotics team which earned several laurels for my college. Under my leadership, our team managed to improve our ranking from a lowly 56th place to a high of 3rd position on an all-India level within just three short years.

    One of my biggest challenges was my final year project which was based on the identification, detection and reporting of a medical condition through Image processing techniques and the use of the correct algorithm to detect these anomalies. Titled – Automatic Detection of Microaneurysms in colour fundus using Circular Hough Transform – my team successfully managed to achieve all its stated objectives at the Mumbai based Aditya Jyot Eye Hospital.
