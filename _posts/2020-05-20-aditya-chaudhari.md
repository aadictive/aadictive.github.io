Hey There, Welcome everyone to my website! I am Aditya Chaudhari, currently pursuing my Master's at SUNY Binghamton in Computer Science. This is my first blog on this website and I will be writing here a couple of blogs in future on various topics.

The topics that the blogs would cover, might vary from Science & Technology, Research, DIYs, new software, Job finding preparations and a bit of my personal experience. I hope that all of you enjoy it and do subscribe to my mailing list to stay in touch!
